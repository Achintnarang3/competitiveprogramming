search space : distance between first and last index of the array

ANS: Using binary search
suppose array is of size 9 with stalls at 1,2,4,8,9
mid of 0-9 is 4
we put a cow at 1, cannot put next cow at 2 cuz distance from 1 is < 4, same for at position 4, can put at 8. now third cow we cannot put at 9. so taking 4 as distance was incorrect.
Move backward from 4, now end is 3. mid is now 1 (0-3)
cuz if you cant place at 4, you wont be able to place at 5,6,7,8,9 either.
now we can place at 1,2,4. now look at right of 1. mid point is 2.
yes we can place at 2. now look at 3. mid point 3 as only 3 is left.
hence answer 3.

Time Complexity : O(N Log(N))
